# Predictive-Model-Semiconductor-SECOM
SECOM is a multivariate dataset providing information of a complex modern semi-conductor manufacturing process. These information are signals collected from various sensors and measurement points, which are used to monitor the whole production line. "If we consider each type of signal as a feature, then feature selection may be applied to identify the most relevant signals. [...] the labels represent a simple pass/fail yield for in house line testing, [...] Where â€“1 corresponds to a pass and 1 corresponds to a fail and the data time stamp is for that specific test point. " (UCI - Machine Learning Repository (2008), http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/secom).
